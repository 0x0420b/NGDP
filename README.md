# NGDP
An ugly bot that monitors client builds. Tries to eat as little memory as possible.

## What. How.

This bot connects to IRC servers. Listens to a few commands. HTTP server is an option if you want to proxy downloading files from Blizzard's CDNs.

Note: This needs admin rights on Windows for the HTTP server.

## Command line arguments

- `--conf`, `-c`: Path to the XML configuration file. Default to `conf.xml`
- `--autodownload`, `-a`: Path to a txt file of game files to download.
- `--httpDomain`, `-d`: Domain name for the bot's public HTTP server to be reached at.
- `--bindAddr`, `-b`: The endpoint to bind on. Defaults to `0.0.0.0`.
- `--bindPort`, `-p`: The port to bind on. Defaults to `8080`.
- `--hasHttp`, `-h`: Activates the HTTP server. Implied by `--bindAddr` or `--bindPort`.
